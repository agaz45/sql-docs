# Teradata source

[!INCLUDE[ssis-appliesto](../../includes/ssis-appliesto-ssvrpluslinux-asdb-asdw-xxx.md)]

The Teradata source extracts data from Teradata databases by using:

- A table or view.

- The results of an SQL statement.

The source uses a Teradata connection manager to connect to Teradata source. For more information, see [Teradata connection manager](teradata-connection-manager.md).

## Troubleshooting the Teradata source

You can log the calls that the Teradata source makes to the Teradata Parallel Transporter API (TPT API). You can enable package logging and select the **Diagnostic** event at the package level to log the calls.

You can log the ODBC calls that the Teradada source makes to the Teradata ODBC driver by enabling the ODBC driver manager trace. For more information, see the Microsoft documentation on *How To Generate an ODBC Trace with ODBC the Data Source Administrator*.

## Parallelism

Teradata source supports parallelism that export jobs can access same table or different tables at same time. Database variable called **MaxLoadTasks** sets the limit of the number of Export jobs that can run at the same time. You can define this maximum number with this **MaxLoadTasks** variable.

## Teradata source custom properties

The custom properties of the Teradata source are as below. All properties are read/write.

|SqlCommand|String|The SQL command to be executed when AccessMode is set to SQL Command.|
|TableName|String|The name of the table with the data to be used when AccessMode is set to Table Name.|
|TenacityHours|Integer|The number of hours the TPT driver attempts to log on when the maximum number of load/export operations are already running. The default is 4 hours. This property is in **Advanced Editor**|
|TenacitySleep|Integer|Minutes the TPT driver pauses before attempting to log on when limit is reached. Limit is defined by the **MaxSessions** and **TenacityHours** properties. Default is 6 minutes. This property is in **Advanced Editor**|
|UnicodePassThrough|Boolean|Off (default): Disable the Unicode Pass Through. <br>On: Enable the Unicode Pass Through|

## Configuring Teradata source

You can configure the Teradata source programmatically or through the SSIS Designer.

The Teradata Source Editor is shown in blow picture. It contains Connection Manager Page, Columns Page, and Error Output Page.

For more information, see one of the following sections:

- [Teradata Source Editor (Connection Manager page)](#teradata-source-editor-connection-manager-page)
- [Teradata Source Editor (Columns Page)](#teradata-source-editor-columns-page)
- [Teradata Source Editor (Error Output Page)](#teradata-source-editor-error-output-page)

![source editor](media/teradata-source.png)

The **Advanced Editor** dialog box contains the properties that can be set programmatically.
To open the **Advanced Editor** dialog box:
- In the Data Flow screen of your Integration Services project, right-click the Oracle source and select **Show Advanced Editor**.

For more information about the properties that you can set in the **Advanced Editor** dialog box, see [Teradata source custom properties](#teradata-source-custom-properties).

## Teradata Source Editor (Connection Manager page)

The name of the selected external (source) column is the default output name. While you can input any unique name.
>[!NOTE]
>
>If there are columns with unsupported data types, there will be a warning shown the data types are not supported, and related columns will be removed from mapping columns.

## Teradata Source Editor (Error Output Page)
