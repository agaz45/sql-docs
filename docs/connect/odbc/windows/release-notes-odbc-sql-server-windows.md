# Release Notes for ODBC to SQL Server on Windows

[!INCLUDE[Driver_ODBC_Download](../../../includes/driver_odbc_download.md)]

This release notes article describes what's new for the Microsoft ODBC driver to SQL Server on Windows.

<!--
PLEASE USE THE STANDARD 2-COLUMN TABLE FORMAT!

For all our Release Notes articles (What's New too?), we are standardizing on the 2-column format that you see here for version "## 17.3".

Going forward, all new additions to this article must use the 2-column format.

Also, use the shorter ## H2 title format, which eliminates all the redundant constants, and appends the date-added.
One beneift of shortness is the avoidance of the annoying wrapping of unnecessarily long H2 titles in the rightNav.
- OLD H2:  ## What's New in the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../includes/msconame_md.md)] ODBC Driver 17.3 for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on Windows
- NEW H2:  ## 17.3, February 2019

By the way, in GitHub, the file name is changing today 2019/03/30:
- FROM:  docs/connect/odbc/windows/release-notes.md
- TO  :  docs/connect/odbc/windows/release-notes-odbc-sql-server-windows.md

Thank you.
GeneMi (and CraigG).  2019/03/30.
