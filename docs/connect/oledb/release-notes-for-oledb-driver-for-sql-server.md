### Bugs fixed

| Bug fixed | Details |
| :-------- | :------ |
| Fixed drop index logic in [IIndexDefinition::DropIndex](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2106448). | Previous versions of the OLE DB driver can't drop a primary key index when the schema ID and the user ID of the owner of the index aren't equal. |

### Bugs fixed

| :-------- | :------ |
| Fixed non-interactive Azure Active Directory authentication in multithreaded apartment (MTA). | The OLE DB Driver 18.2.1 incorrectly tries to change the COM concurrency model on an apartment that was previously initialized as multithreaded (MTA). As a result, in an application that makes more than one subsequent call to [CoInitialize](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2092520) or [CoInitializeEx](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2092521) prior to calling the [IDBInitialize::Initialize](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2092522) interface, the driver fails to connect when using any of the Azure Active Directory authentication modes. |
